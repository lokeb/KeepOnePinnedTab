✔ Consider ignoring tabs in collapsed groups when counting how many tabs besides our special pinned one there are @done(24-01-06 16:31)
	Goal: similar behavior with collapsed tab group, as when those tabs don't exist
	✔ This will require the "tabGroups" permission > requires me to move to manifest v3 > requires switching from a background page to a service worker @done(24-01-06 16:31)
	✔ Code bits @done(24-01-06 16:31)
		Tab.groupId - ID of group tab is in, or chrome.tabGroups.TAB_GROUP_ID_NONE (-1) if it's not in a group
		var groupId = targetWindow.tabs[1].groupId;
		var group = chrome.tabGroups.get(groupId);
		console.log(group.collapsed);
	✔ Also skip over it when deciding which tab to focus (to unfocus pinned tab) @done(24-01-06 16:31)
☐ Make tab URL filter a little less granular?
	Already just checks the beginning (I think)
	☐ Make http vs https not matter?
		Might need a setting in this case, though - maybe an "exact match" checkbox?
☐ Consider new setting for ignoring all pinned tabs in counting - so "keep one non-pinned tab open".
New plan for options:
	☐ All keys move into constant objects (like SettingsKeys) which are then shared via chrome.storage.session.get/set
	Settings page gets revamped:
		Pinned page choice:	
			☐ Now it's just a field with buttons that prefill values
			☐ Maybe bold the currently "selected" button (the one whose value matches the current URL's value)?
			☐ Stop loading/saving specific values for the "page" vs. the "custom URL" - how it's just 1 value, the "pinned URL"
				This will require some conversion logic in the service worker:
					☐ Create a helper function to convert back to old keys for testing against
					☐ Check for the old settings keys. If found:
						☐ Calculate the corresponding pinned URL (basically what calculatePinnedURL already is)
						☐ Store the new pinned URL value in sync storage
						☐ Delete the old settings keys from sync storage (assuming that's a thing I can do?)
		☐ Never focus pinned tab checkbox - keep it, but consider rewording slightly
