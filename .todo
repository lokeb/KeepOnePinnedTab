Consider ignoring tabs in collapsed groups when counting how many tabs besides our special pinned one there are
	Goal: similar behavior with collapsed tab group, as when those tabs don't exist
	This will require the "tabGroups" permission > requires me to move to manifest v3 > requires switching from a background page to a service worker
	Code bits
		Tab.groupId - ID of group tab is in, or chrome.tabGroups.TAB_GROUP_ID_NONE (-1) if it's not in a group
		var groupId = targetWindow.tabs[1].groupId;
		var group = chrome.tabGroups.get(groupId);
		console.log(group.collapsed);
Clean out "legacy" handling for old settings key
Make tab filter a little less granular?
	Already just checks the beginning (I think)
	Make http vs https not matter?
		Might need a setting in this case, though - maybe an "exact match" checkbox?
Consider new setting for ignoring all pinned tabs in counting - so "keep one non-pinned tab open".
