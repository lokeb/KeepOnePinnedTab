Remove old key support after a month or two
Actually implement blankLight choice
Make warning message about custom option dynamic, only when that option is selected?
Add optional behavior to switch away from the tab in question immediately?
	chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(tabActivated);
Grab settings from storage only when changed, like other extension does
	chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener(updateOptions);
	Only change tab URLs that match our old URL?
Add setting for whether it will immediately apply to detached tabs
	Only add handler for that if it's checked.
Maybe it makes sense to check all windows per trigger?
	Would help with detach case, if we're not handling it directly.
