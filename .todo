☐ Make tab URL filter a little less granular?
	Already just checks the beginning (I think)
	☐ Make http vs https not matter?
		Might need a setting in this case, though - maybe an "exact match" checkbox?
☐ Consider new setting for ignoring all pinned tabs in counting - so "keep one non-pinned tab open".
✔ New plan for options: @done(24-01-06 22:58)
	✔ All keys move into constant objects (like SettingsKeys) which are then shared via chrome.storage.session.get/set @done(24-01-06 22:58)
	Settings page gets revamped:
		Pinned page choice:	
			✔ Now it's just a field with buttons that prefill values @done(24-01-06 22:58)
			✔ Maybe bold the currently "selected" button (the one whose value matches the current URL's value)? @done(24-01-06 22:58)
			✔ Stop loading/saving specific values for the "page" vs. the "custom URL" - how it's just 1 value, the "pinned URL" @done(24-01-06 22:58)
				This will require some conversion logic in the service worker:
					✔ Create a helper function to convert back to old keys for testing against @done(24-01-06 22:58)
					✔ Check for the old settings keys. If found: @done(24-01-06 22:58)
						✔ Calculate the corresponding pinned URL (basically what calculatePinnedURL already is) @done(24-01-06 22:58)
						✔ Store the new pinned URL value in sync storage @done(24-01-06 22:58)
						✔ Delete the old settings keys from sync storage (assuming that's a thing I can do?) @done(24-01-06 22:58)
		✔ Never focus pinned tab checkbox - keep it, but consider rewording slightly @done(24-01-06 22:58)
