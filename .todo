Bug: adding extra pinned tab to first window when opening a new one

Remove old key support after a month or two
	OR: phase out old settings immediately, in tab-creating logic.

Make warning message about custom option dynamic, only when that option is selected?

Add optional behavior to switch away from the tab in question immediately?
	chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(tabActivated);
Grab settings from storage when changed, like other extension does
	chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener(updateOptions);
	Only change tab URLs that match our old URL?
